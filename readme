Naming conventions
------------------

Prefix IDs and classes with your app's name. The same holds for JavaScript and PHP functions if you don't program object-oriented. Your PHP classes should start with your app name too.

Don't use PHP 5.3 or 5.4 features so that the app works on hosts with PHP 5.2.

TODO: it might make sense to subclass Page. $page could be overwritten or other variables that might be introduced later.

Add a new app:

git submodule add git@github.com:SpaceApi/spaceapiapp_<appname>.git <appname>
git commit -m "<appname> added"
git push origin master
